# Mini Search Engine (Phase 2 PoC)

This project is a simple Python-based mini search engine created for my MSCS 532 - Data Structure and Algorithms class. It demonstrates how tokenization, inverted indexing, and TF-IDF scoring work together to support basic keyword search. 

## Features 

- Builds an inverted index using Python dictionaries
- Tracks term frequency (TF) and document frequency (DF)
- Normalizes and tokenizes text
- Ranks documents using TF-IDF
- Handles edge cases including empty queries, punctuation, no matches
- Runs in a single file: `mini_search.py`

## How to Run
```bash
python3 mini_search.py
